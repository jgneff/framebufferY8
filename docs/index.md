# Benchmarks

This is the Web site for the [FramebufferY8 Benchmarks](https://github.com/jgneff/framebufferY8) repository on GitHub.
This site documents the results of the benchmark tests comparing the new `FramebufferY8` class with the old `Framebuffer` class.
These classes are part of the Monocle implementation of the Glass windowing component in the JavaFX Graphics module.

## 2019-12

The results of my first set of tests in December 2019 are published on the [2019-12](2019-12/) page.
